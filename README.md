Welcome to the home of feedback and community at Fimio! We‚Äôre excited you‚Äôre here. 

This repo is new and suggestions and bugs (if any) are few so far, but we are looking forward to building out a strong feedback collection process with you, our community. 

## Contributing Feedback 
First thing‚Äôs first - when you have a suggestion, please take a look through the existing discussions and if you find a suggestion similar to what you are thinking, simply add an up-vote or join into the existing community discussion.

### Already looked, and can't find a related discussion? Time to start your own!

To start things off, select the appropriate category and give your discussion a descriptive title, making sure to add the appropriate label so we know what your suggestion is all about:

|Label|Description|
|-|-|
|‚ú® Feature Request| New Features for the Platform
|üêõ Bug|  For Reporting Pesky Bugs
|üí° Idea| Other Brilliant Ideas
|‚ùì Questions| For Your Burning Questions

Once you've created a title, and provided some context, we'll review your suggestion and feedback from the community to help our team prioritize features and improvements, recognizing that we cannot guarantee that we will be able to move forward with all suggestions.


### We‚Äôre discussions first!

Conversations always start with a discussion! If the team determines action is needed based on a discussion, we‚Äôll convert it to an issue to track, no action needed from you (unless we ask, of course :wink:)


## Disclaimer

While the Fimio team will carefully consider every bug and feature request carefully, we are unable to make any guarantees that feedback provided in these discussions will actually be developed or delivered.
